# TD - Python Git Linux

First use of Github while learning Linux and Python during one ESILV's course.

You will find here some code to deal with the shell in Linux and perform many actions (walk through directories and files, give permissions, write some bash...).

There is also some parts about Git and how to use it to manage files, directories, branches...

For the moment there is no Python content.
