## Exercise 1: Extract data from a website
The Domesday Book is the greatest medieval census. It lists the manors (private properties) in every place of every county in England in the years 1066 and 1086, before and after the Norman conquest. OpenDomesday presents it in a modern-human-readable website, as well as an *application programming interface* (API). We will use this API to extract some data from our command-line shell.

### Exercise 1.1: curl

Check the data on https://opendomesday.org/api/, for instance
- *https://opendomesday.org/api/1.0/county/*
- *https://opendomesday.org/api/1.0/place/2346/*
- *https://opendomesday.org/api/1.0/manor/181/*
